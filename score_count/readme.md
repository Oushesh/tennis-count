### Papers and Approach:
    * https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01430.pdf
    *
    * Temporarily segmenting out the rallies. (DONE)
    * Scorecard & Score Extraction (OCR Problem)
    * OCR Libraries could be used: Google Tesseract.
    *

### Current Pipeline:
    1) Deep Learning Based
        * Pass in TextFuseNet:
    2) OpenCV OCR + Tesseract Engine: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/17/opencv-ocr-and-text-recognition-with-tesseract/
